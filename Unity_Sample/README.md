# Unity Neo4J Sample Project

This project uses the neo4j-dotnet-driver (https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-dotnet-driver) in Unity 2019.1.0f2.

The driver for Unity and an example scene (including the driver) can be found in the __Neo4j.Driver.Unity__ folder.

The graph used in the example scene can be found in __Unity_Sample/ExampleGraph.txt__.

## Notes:

- This project requires a running Neo4J Server. 

- When using an older Unity version, you might need to set the *Player Settings / Other Settings / Scripting Runtime Version* to __.NET 4.x Equivalent__.
