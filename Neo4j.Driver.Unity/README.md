# Unity-Neo4J

This Unitypackage (built with Unity 2019.1.0f2) includes the neo4j-dotnet-driver 1.7.2 (https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-dotnet-driver).

An example scene (including the driver) can be found in the __Unity_Sample__ folder.

## Notes:

- The driver requires a running Neo4J Server. 

- When using an older Unity version, you might need to set the *Player Settings / Other Settings / Scripting Runtime Version* to __.NET 4.x Equivalent__.
